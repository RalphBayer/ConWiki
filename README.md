. mac    : press Command+spacebar to launch Spotlight and type "Terminal," then double-click the search result.
. linux  : press Ctrl+Alt+T in Ubuntu, or press Alt+F2, type in gnome-terminal, and press enter.

Then you will need to do a python install of Flask using pip.
Type: pip install flask

Download this github repository to any place you can accsess on your computure and unzip all the files. Then keep going throught the unziped folders untill you reach a file called start.bat. Once you find it, double click on it 
  
### How To use
At the moment ConWiki is in it's early days of construction so there is very limited functionality.
However, to open a webpage and use ConWiki, go to the location you have saved the files and double click on
start.bat every time you want to use ConWiki. (NOTE: ConWiki has only been tested for google and firefox at the moment,
layout or text could look a little odd. If you use another browser then please let me know how it looks for you.).
