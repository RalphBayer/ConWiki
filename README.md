## Getting started

### Installation
Currently, the only way to install this is through git or github.com. Click on 'Clone or Download' and then 
download the files however you want. Place the downloaded (and unzipped) files in a location easily accessible 
on your PC.
  
### How To use
At the moment ConWiki is in it's early days of construction so there is very limited functionality.
However, to open a webpage and use ConWiki, go to the location you have saved the files and double click on
homepage.html every time you want to use ConWiki. Optionally, you can open any browser you use, then drag
and drop homepage.html into said browser. (NOTE: ConWiki has only been tested for google and firefox at the moment,
layout or text could look a little odd).
