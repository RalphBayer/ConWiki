        <h2> Find An Article </h2>
        <pre>
For searches, there is a search box at the top of every page.
Type what you are looking for in the box and ConWiki will try
it's best to match your query. Select any page in the list to
go to that page. There are other ways to browse and explore
ConWiki articles; many of these will be links in one article
leading to another.
        </pre>

        <h2> Edit An Article </h2>
        <pre>
To edit an article click the edit button in the bar at the top
of any page. Once you click on that button you will be able to
change the contents of the article. You will also be able to
add style to the article with ConWiki's styling syntax.

        </pre>

        <h2> Report A Problem </h2>
        <pre>
If during your time on ConWiki you encounter any problems,
you can report them by visiting this <a href="https://github.com/RalphBayer/ConWiki">GitHub page</a>.
Once at the site you can open a issue, and I will try to
fix it as soon as possible.

However, you can also try to fix these problems your self by
contributing to the code that makes up ConWiki on the same
<a href="https://github.com/RalphBayer/ConWiki">GitHub page</a>. Even suggestions or ideas for how to improve
ConWiki are always welcome.

        <h2> Create An Article </h2>
          <pre>
To create an article click the create button in the bar at the top
of any page. Once you click on that button ConWiki will ask you
for the article's name and where to save the article.
Then an empty article will be created (or one containing a template),
after that you are free to edit the article as much as you want.

          </pre>

          <h2> Style An Article </h2>
          <pre>
To add style to your article such as: links, images, headings etc.
ConWiki has specific keywords to add these. If you already know
how styling works in wikipedia then most of the syntax will remain
the same. For more help, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/RalphBayer/ConWiki">GitHub page</a>
where you will find full documentation for styling.
          </pre>

          <h2> Navigation On ConWiki </h2>
          <pre>
On every single ConWiki page, there will be a side bar with links to
many different parts of ConWiki, your articles and other websites.
The side bar is split into 3 main sections: ConWiki, Articles and Tools.

ConWiki navigation, contains links to all different parts of ConWiki such as
this page and <a href="../homepage.html">home</a>.

Articles, contains folders for all of your articles. These folders might
be named: languages, cultures, geography, world or any name you can think of.

Tools, contains links to other websites or applications that conworlders
or conlangers frequenlty use for their creations.
