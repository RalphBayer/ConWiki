      <h2 class="help_h2"> Find An Article </h2>
      <pre class="help_pre">
    For searches, there is a search box at the top of every page.
    Type what you are looking for in the box and ConWiki will try
    it's best to match your query. Select any page in the list to
    go to that page. There are other ways to browse and explore
    ConWiki articles; many of these will be links in one article
    leading to another.
      </pre>

      <h2 class="help_h2"> Edit An Article </h2>
      <pre class="help_pre">
    To edit an article click the edit button in the bar at the top
    of any page. Once you click on that button you will be able to
    change the contents of the article. You will also be able to
    add style to the article with ConWiki's styling syntax.

      <h2 class="help_h2"> Report A Problem </h2>
      <pre class="help_pre">
    If during your time on ConWiki you encounter any problems,
    you can report them by visiting this <a class="help_a" href="https://github.com/RalphBayer/ConWiki">GitHub page</a>.
    Once at the site you can open a issue, and I will try to
    fix it as soon as possible.

    However, you can also try to fix these problems your self by
    contributing to the code that makes up ConWiki on the same

    after that you are free to edit the article as much as you want.

    To add style to your article such as: links, images, headings etc.
    ConWiki has specific keywords to add these. If you already know
    how styling works in wikipedia then most of the syntax will remain
    the same. For more help, please visit the <a class="help_a" href="https://github.com/RalphBayer/ConWiki">GitHub page</a>
    where you will find full documentation for styling.
